# Project_CubeO

Name of Game: CubeO
Description: You are a cube traveling down a path avoiding obstacles to get...well, to the next level!
Controls/How to Play: You play CubeO with the WASD keys to move around. If you run into an obstacle that isn't the same color as you, you bounce back! If you ever fall off the grey road or exit the screen you die and the game ends. When you run into an obstacle that is the same color as you, it is destroyed and you change colors! When you run into growpoints you slowly grow and the game slowly gets harder. When you get big enough the level ends and you enter the next level. Every new level has harder obstacle groupings to navigate. Your score at the end shows how far you got!
